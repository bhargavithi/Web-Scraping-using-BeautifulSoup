# Web Scraping Tata Cars Data Project

## Project Description

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a web scraping project that extracts information about Tata cars available in India from the ACKO Drive website (https://ackodrive.com/collection/tata-cars/).

### Key Features:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Uses Python libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas) to scrape car data
   - Targets the Tata cars collection page on ACKO Drive

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Makes HTTP requests to fetch webpage content
   - Parses HTML content using BeautifulSoup
   - Verifies successful connection (status code 200)

3. **Data Structure**:
   - The scraped data appears to include comprehensive car details such as:
     - Model names (e.g., Punch, Nexon, Curvv EV)
     - Variants and specifications
     - Pricing information
     - Color options
     - Fuel types (Petrol, Electric)
     - Transmission types (Manual, Automatic)
     - Body types (SUV)
     - Seating capacity

4. **Potential Applications**:
   - Car price comparison tool
   - Market research on Tata's vehicle lineup
   - Inventory tracking system
   - Data analysis of car features and pricing trends

5. **Business Value**:
   - Enables data-driven decision making for car buyers
   - Provides insights into Tata's product offerings
   - Could be extended to track pricing changes over time

The project demonstrates fundamental web scraping techniques that could be expanded to collect more detailed specifications, compare across manufacturers, or track price fluctuations over time.
